# ALMUNDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

## How to run the project

First you shouod build the jar, then you have 2 ways to run the program

1) run it without arguments:

This will run a "demo" with 10 automated calls, after that the program will close.

2) run it with argument 'y':

This will run the full almundo's Callcenter experience and is how it was intended. 

You will have to manually make the calls following the instructions.

## Code explanation (kind of FAQ)

Q1) Why did you do a text-based program?

A1) I don't know, i didn't know how you were testing it and thought this was a cool and fun way to do it. I think i got influenced by RPG games.

Q2) What happens when you recieve the 11th call?

A2) The program puts the call on hold untill there is space.

Q3) What happens when there are no operator left?

A3) The message "Sorry! No employee is available, try next time!" will pop up and the call will end.

Q4) Why there only 1 test: the one asked for?

A4) Because that's all the program do, there isn't much more to test.

Q5) What do you think about the exam?

A5) I think it was quite easy, it was really short and easy and i don't think it compares with what i would have to do if i get the job. It's weird that i didn't had to make an api rest, or the same project but activating the calls via api (with a curl command) or something like that wich would make more sense than just using threadpool.
